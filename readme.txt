Websand Subscription Form. Add Websand Subscriber forms to any post, page, or sidebar. 

== Description ==

#### Websand Subscription Form
This plugin enables a simple widget that can be used to capture and send subscriber information to the fabulous and easy to use Email Marketing and Marketing Automation platform [Websand](http://www.websand.co.uk). 
The widget collects your site visitors' first name and email address and enforces an opt-in when they subscribe - keeping you in line with best practices. 
Behind the scenes you can configure the plugin to add a 'source code' for the signup. This allows you to monitor where your subscribers are coming from and allow you to assign the most appropriate welcome message for them when they subscribe. 
Unfortunately, this plugin isn't much use if you aren't a Websand user. Not to worry though, you can sign up and add some superpowers to your email marketing at http://beta.websandhq.com/

On this page you need to enter a your Websand domain, your Websand API Token and a full URL to a page on your site which out lines your terms and conditions surrouding your email marketing.

You can give your widget a title, you can set a custom thank your URL (where would you like your visitors to be redirected after they sign up) and a custom source code you'd like to give that subscribe from this specific widget.
5.b You can also add Websand subscriber forms to posts, pages and anywhere else in WordPress where you can use shortcodes.

#### Shortcodes
In addition to the widget, the Websand Subscription Form plugin enables shortcodes you can use in your posts and pages to embed signup forms directly in your content. You can read more about shortcodes [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode). Examples of shortcodes using the available options are below:
`[websand] \\ A simple signup form using the default options`
`[websand source_code="my-lovely-source-code"] \\ A signup form which will both tag your subscribers with my-lovely-source-code`
`[websand thank_you="http://www.example.com/thanks.html"] \\ A signup form which will open a page that directs to http://www.example.com/thanks.html after subscribing`
`[websand source_code="my-lovely-source-code" thank_you="http://www.example.com/thanks.html"] \\ A signup form which will both tag your subscribers with my-lovely-source-code and open a page that directs to http://www.example.com/thanks.html after subscribing`

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

#### Can I style the widget?
The Websand Subscription Form widget comes with minimal default styling so it should blend straight in to your existing theme. If you would like to customise it however, the following CSS classes will be helpful: 

`
.websand-for-wordpress-widget { ... } /* the widget form */
.websand-form-group { ... } /* form input groups */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget p { ... } /* form paragraphs */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget label { ... } /* labels */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget input { ... } /* input fields */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget input[type="checkbox"] { ... } /* checkboxes */
.websand-for-wordpress-widget input[type="submit"] { ... } /* submit button */
`

You can either customise your theme's stylesheets or use a plugin like [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/) to use these classes and style your widget. 

#### Can I use multiple widgets with different source codes on my site?
Yes indeed! You can have multiple widgets with different source codes - just drag new widgets from the left column of the *Appearance > Widgets* page and add them to the theme areas on the right - each widget has it's own settings.
